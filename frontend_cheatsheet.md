## Introduction

### JavaScript vs Java

**Java -**
- statically typed and compiled
- more robust since things can not be reassigned a different datatype

**Javascript -** 
- dynamically typed interpreted language
- useful for flexible in front end

e.g. 

***Java***

```java
Bear bear = new Bear("Baloo");
bear = new Cat() does not work
```

***JavaScript***

```js
bear = new Bear()
bear = "lol"
```

**Java and JavaScript has nothing to do with each other!! It used to be called LifeScript but was renamed just because Java was the most important back end language at the time.**

Official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript.

**Node.js** is javascript but for backend!

## Node.js

|No.	|Javascript	|NodeJS|
|------------|----------------|---------------|
|1.	|Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website.	|NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.|
|2.|	Javascript can only be run in the browsers.	|We can run Javascript outside the browser with the help of NodeJS.
|3.|	It is basically used on the client-side.	|It is mostly used on the server-side.
|4.|	Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.	|Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
|5.|	Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.	|V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node.js that parses and runs Javascript. 
|6.|	Javascript is used in frontend development.	|Nodejs is used in server-side development.
|7.|	Some of the javascript frameworks are RamdaJS, TypedJS, etc. |Some of the Nodejs modules are Lodash, express etc. These modules are to be imported from npm. 
|8.|	It is the upgraded version of ECMA script that uses Chromeâ€™s V8 engine written in C++.|Nodejs is written in C, C++ and Javascript.

In terminal we can use `node` to enter the REPL and code `js` in the terminal environment. `CTRL` + `D` to exit the environment. Instead we will be writing scripts in Visual Studo Code.

## JavaScript Shortcuts

|Syntax|Description|
|------|------|
|log + `TAB`|autocompletes `console.log()`|
|`node [js file]`| runs file in terminal |
|`node --print-bytecode [file]`|shows what it takes to compile and run the code|

## JavaScript Basics

### Formatting

We can format a String through `${}`. Inside the curly braces we can put any kind of operation and it will execute it. e.g. `2 + 2` , `temperature * 2` , `personName + [other String]`

```js
personName = "Ed";
temperature = 36;

console.log(`Hello ${personName}`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${temperature} degrees today`); //much simpler than python format!
```

### Conditionals

`1 == "1"` - returns true as JavaScript asks, "Can we make it work?"

`1 === "1"` - checks the data type as well, therefore this is much more reliable in the beginning as we are used to statically typed languages

`!==` - three symbols is always going to be data type check compared to `!=`

`"a" < "b"` - can be used for alphabetic checks

e.g.

```js
if(userGuess === secretNumber){
    console.log(`Congrats, good guess, the secret number was ${secretNumber}`);
} else if (userGuess > secretNumber){
    console.log("Guessed too High");
} else {
    console.log(`Guessed too Low, guess again`);
}
```

Everything has a **TRUTHY** or **FALSY** value. Therefore just the number `15` counts as a true boolean for conditionals. This is the same for Strings. Both are inherently **TRUTHY**.

```js
loggedInUser = null;
loggedInUser = "Zsolt" //if this line is commented out, then falsy

if(loggedInUser){
    //execute code
}
```

### ***Falsy values:***

- `0`
- `null`
- `""`
- `NaN`
- `undefined` (when forgotten to initialise with a value)

### Type Coercion

This is JavaScript trying to make things work, providing flexibility so that it does not break down.

e.g.

`55 + "hello"` - makes entire of it a String

`[ ] + " "` - allowed

`5 + [ ]` - also fine

`[ ] + { }` - array + object gives `[object Object]`

### Arrays

We can define an empty array through `longArray = Array(16)` with a certain size or through setting values,

```js
emptyArray = [];
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5];
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
badIdea = [0, "a", true, numbers];
```

|Methods|Syntax|Description|Returns|
|----|----|----|----|
|add| `myArray.unshift([value])`|adds an element to the front of the array|array length|
|add|`myArray.push([value])`|adds an element to the array at the end|array length|
|add| `myArray.splice(index, 0, value)`| adds the element into the array at index|
|access| `myArray[index]`|accesses the element at index|<-|
|size|`myArray.length`|the length of the array|<-|
|remove| `myArray.shift()`| removes the ***first*** element| element removed|
|remove| `myArray.pop()`| removes the ***last*** element of the array| element removed|
|remove| `myArray.splice(index, amount)`| removes a certain amount of elements at index and after|
|contains|`myArray.includes(value)`|returns true if array contains value| true or false|
|index| `myArray.indexOf(value)`| returns (first?) index of the value in the array|
|sort| `myArray.sort()`| sorts the array by numerical or alphabetical order|


### Objects

We can define an object just as we expected from a JSON body.

```js
alice = {
    name : 'Alice',
    age : 21,
    favColour : 'blue',
    pets: ['bobby','callum']
};

bob = {
    age: 28,
    name: 'Bob',
    favColour: 'blue'
};
```

Keys **can not** start with a number, have to be unique and naming is important! 

We can access an objects properties through `alice.pets` or `alice["pets"]`. If the key has a weird name (e.g. has a hyphen), the latter is needed to access it.

Sometimes we want to grab the key and access it rather than modifying it directly through the above.

```js
cat = {
    name: 'Cuddles',
    age: 15
}

key = 'name';
cat[key] = 'Fluffy';
cat.breed = 'calico';
```

|Methods|Syntax|Description|
|----|----|----|
|add|`myObject.[new key name] = [value]`|we can add a property just by calling it in .js|
|remove| `delete myObject.[key]`|removes the key from the object|
|keys| `Object.keys([object name])`| returns all the keys of the object as an array|
|values| `Object.values([object name])`| returns all the values of the object as an array|

### Loops

Similar to other codes,


***For***
```js
shoppingList = ['milk', 'eggs', 'bread', 'apples', 'kimchi', 'tea'];

for (item of shoppingList){
    console.log(item.toUpperCase()); //same method for Strings
}

for (index = 0; index < shoppingList.length; index++) {
    console.log(shoppingList[index]);
}

for (index = shoppingList.length-1; index > -1 ; index--) { //reverse order
    console.log(shoppingList[index].toUpperCase());
}

//looping through objects

for (key in alice){ //simple
    value = alice[key];
    console.log(`The ${key} is ${value}`);
}

for (key in alice) { //default
    if (Object.hasOwnProperty.call(alice, key)) {
        element = alice[key];
        console.log(element);
    }
}
```

***While***
```js
counter = 0;

while (counter<10){
    console.log(counter);
    counter++;
}

while(true){
    rand = Math.random(); //random number between 0,1
    console.log(rand);
    if(rand>0.9){
        break;
    }
}
```

## Scope

By default all variables are available on a global scope. To counter this, we can manage the scope through,

### Block scoped - `const` and `let`

This only allows the block `({ })` to access this.

```js
let age = 25; //allows reassigning
const name = "Yuko"; //should not be changed and prevents it
```

### Lexical Scope

Defining outside of the block will allow it to be accessed. This is similar to the parent, child relationship we have in Java. e.g,

```js
let numberToPrint = 0;

for(let number of numbers){
    numberToPrint = number; // can access variable outside the block
    console.log(`Value of number inside loop: ${numberToPrint}`);
}
```

### Examples

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for(number of numbers){
    console.log(`Value of number inside loop: ${number}`);
}

console.log(number)
```

The above code, the `number` in the for loop is globally available, making it possible to print out another `5` at the end. Instead, we can add the type `let`,

```js
for(let number of numbers){
    //code
}
```

which makes it unavailable outside the loop. This brings up an error when we try to print out `number` outside the block.

When dealing with Arrays, you can add and remove from the array even though it's a `const myArray;`. You can even change the values of the elements. However you can not assign it to be a different array. e.g. `myArray = diffArray;`

This is the same with objects.

## Functions

Order of named functions does not matter as JavaScript hoists functions to the top. This is due to the interpreter. Below we have examples of named functions,

```js
// named functions
function greet(timeOfDay, name){
    console.log(`Good ${checkTime(timeOfDay)}, ${name}`);
}

function checkTime(number){
    if(number< 12){
        return "morning";
    } else if(number>=12 && number <18){
        return "afternoon";
    } else{
        return "evening";
    }
}

greet(19,`Kevin`);
```

Anonymous functions do not have a name and can be assigned to a variable,

```js
//anonymous functions
const sum = function(number1, number2){
    return number1+number2;
}

console.log(sum(1,2));
```

Named functions are not as common, instead usually it's a safe bet to have anonymous functions which can be set to a variable and passed around the code. **Anonymous functions** order does matter!! This is not hoisted by the interpreter. Should default to anonymous functions.

**Arrow functions** came in at ES6, 

```js
//arrow functions
const multiply = (number1, number2) => { //longer implementation
    return number1 + number2;
}

OR

const multiply = (number1, number2) => number1 + number2; //simpler with implicit return

console.log(multiply(2,5));
```

This is much simpler out of the three and since it has come in recently, not as much use as anonymous functions but should be a nice default as well for future.

## Package Management Tool

Packages are code that other people have written which can be used. These are essentially libraries in Python.

Maven is a PMT that we are used to. Gradle is also another. Both can do similar things but not everything that each can do.

In JavaScript, we have NPM and yarn. 

NPM is Node Package Manager. Essentially how it works is that if a package relies on another one and that relies on another etc, this helps make sure you have the dependencies needed. 

### Setup

(Npm should come with node)

`npm init` in the terminal at the root folder *(like git)* 

Hit `enter` and can add description, entry point, test command, git repository and keywords. The flag `-y` after `npm init` skips through all.

This creates a `package.json` file.

`npm install [package name]` or `npm i [package name]` installs a package

```js
//package.json
{
  "name": "npm_intro",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Kibiko",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "five": "^0.8.0" //dependency added, the ^ means it takes most updates or 0.8.0
  }
}
```

A new file called `package-lock.json` is created along with a `node_modules` folder. The `package-lock.json` file should not be changed as it keeps the specific version of the dependency. The `node_modules` folder is one thing to be very familiar with.

This folder contains the code where the dependency is. This contains the source code, ignores, readmes etc. This gives you everything to inspect and change however you want.

If the `node_modules` folder is nuked, you can use `npm install` to get the package back. This way, you do not have to send over the entire node_modules folders but just the `package.json` since it has the dependencies needed. This also helps with storage, you can always remove the node modules when the project is not in use and install it when needed.

NOTE: Always create a `.gitignore` file that ignores `node_modules`.

*.gitignore*
```
node_modules
```

### Using Packages

We can import the package into a file through,

```js
const five = require("five");

console.log(five.japanese());
```

Now we can call the methods of the package which we assigned `five` to be.

## Testing

Most popular packages are chai, mocha and jest. Jest by far is the most downloaded testing package with regular support.

`npm install -D jest` - the extra flag makes devDependencies rather than dependencies in the `package.json` file. The testing package is only useful for the developers and not the end user. This is why we need the tag for Jest. If we publish the code, Jest will not be a part of it.

### Importing and Exporting Functions

To import functions, we have to make sure to export them first from the file.

```js
//calculator.js
const sum = (number1, number2) => {
    return number1 + number2;
}

module.exports = {sum} //needed to make function avaiable globally
```

A test file should always have the naming convention `[name].test.js`,

```js
//calculator.test.js
const {sum} = require('./calculator'); //imports sum function from calculator.js 
                                       //through file path ./calculator
```

To use the Jest testing framework, we call the `test()` method with arguments,

```js
test("can add two small positive numbers", () => {
    //Arrange
    const expected = 5;
    //Act
    const actual = sum(2,3);
    //Assert
    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
})
```

To run our package of test and calculator, we modify the scripts in `package.json`,

```js
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }

===========>

"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
```

When we run `npm test`, it runs the tests for us and spits out the results of the tests. In reality we need more than just one test for a function. A good way to distinguish between blocks of tests is by adding a `describe()`,

```js
//calculator.test.js
const {sum} = require('./calculator');

describe('addition functionality', () => {

test("can add two small positive numbers", () => {
    //Arrange
    const expected = 5;
    //Act
    const actual = sum(2,3);
    //Assert
    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
});

test("can add two small negative numbers", () => {
    //Arrange
    const expected = -12;
    //Act
    const actual = sum(-7,-5);
    //Assert
    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
});

});
```

### Test Coverage

To add test coverage in JavaScript, we add a new script in the `package.json`,

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
  },
```

We then call it through `npm run test:coverage` since this script is a custom one that we have made to test the coverage of our code. This creates a `coverage` folder which shows the reports in the `lcov-report`. Handily, we have the `index.html` file which can be opened in browser to show the coverage in a nice way.

## Constructors & Prototypes

### Constructors

In JavaScript, we can use a function like a class and constructor without needing to define the properties of the class beforehand. Constructors by default is capitalised and at the same time, methods can be included in the function,

```js
const User = function(name, age, email){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.email = email

    this.setName = (newName) => { //inefficient
        this.name = newName;
    }
}

const user = new User("Kevin", 30, "kevinjunchan@gmail.com")
user.setName("Bob");
```

However we end up with a redundancy where the method is included in every object that we have created. Therefore it is not useful to put the method with the constructor. Instead we put it in as a prototype.

### Prototypes

This allows us to define methods outside of the constructor. NOTE: lambdas (=>) do not work as a method definer in a prototype. We have to use an anonymous function instead,

```js
User.prototype.setName = function(newName) {
    this.name = newName;
}

const kevin = new User("Kevin", 30, "kevinjunchan@gmail.com");

kevin.setName("Bob");
```

### Modules

We can export the constructor and methods to be available to other files (modules), similar to when we exported the function for testing where we used `module.exports = {sum}`. In our case, we export from the constructor,

```js
//User.js

//constructor, getters and setters, methods

module.exports = User;
```

and in the modules that we use the class,

```js
//index.js

const User = require("./User");

//use methods and create objects
```

### Inheritance

### Employee Module

In order to implement inheritance in JavaScript, we can import the `User` class into another class. In our example we create an `Employee` class.

```js
const User = require("./User");

const Employee = function(name, age, email, role){
    User.call(this, name, age, email);
    this.role = role;
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(Employee.prototype, User.prototype);

const jack = new Employee("Jack", 21, "jack@gmail.com", "Software Engineer");
jack.setName("Jimbo");
```

In the `Employee` constructor, similar to super in Java, we call the properties from the `User` class through `User.call(this, [properties])`. In order to inherit the methods as well, we include the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method to make Employee prototypes from User prototypes.

We can also check if the Employee is a child of the User module through,

`console.log(jack instanceof User);`

### Customer Module

We also create a `Customer` module which extends the `User` module and inherits the methods while having a new property and methods related to `billingAddress`.

```js
const User = require("./User");

const Customer = function(name, email, billingAddress) {
    User.call(this, name, email);
    this.billingAddress = billingAddress;
}

Customer.prototype.getBillingAddress = function() { return this.billingAddress; }
Customer.prototype.setBillingAddress = function(billingAddress){
    this.billingAddress = billingAddress;
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(Customer.prototype, User.prototype);

module.exports = Customer;
```

### Higher Order Functions

We can have higher order functions, meaning functions nested inside another function. We can take in a function as an argument to be used. e.g. calculator,

```js
const sum = (number1, number2) => {
    console.log(number1 + number2);
};

const subtract = (number1, number2) => {
    console.log(number1 - number2);
};

const multiply = (number1, number2) => {
    console.log(number1 * number2);
}


const doCalculation = (number1, number2, callback) => {
    callback(number1, number2);
};

doCalculation(4,5,multiply);
doCalculation(4,5,sum);
doCalculation(4,5,subtract);
```

Whenever we pass in a function into a different one, we need to name it `callback` for convention. Another way to define a callback is through putting the method into the argument itself,

```js
doCalculation(2,3, (number1, number2) => {
    console.log(number1 / number2);
});
```

This is mostly used for situational problems where the function does not need to be called over and over.

## Enumeration

Instead of for loops to print out elements in an array, we can use higher order functions,

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const letters = [`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`];

const printElement = (arrayElement) => {
    console.log(arrayElement);
};

numbers.forEach(printElement);
letters.forEach(printElement);
```

This way, we can make it much simpler to alter and change if needed. The `forEach()` method for Arrays takes in a function that will apply it to every element in the array. More methods are included in [Arrays Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

### Mapping

`Array.prototype.map()` takes in a function, `f(x)` and applies to to every element in the array and creates a new array with the function applied, `[f(x_1), f(x_2), f(x_3) etc...]`

e.g.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
    return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers);
```

This is essentially the same as `forEach()` but a new array is returned. This is useful for an Array of objects to get values. e.g. people array with person objects with a name property.

### Filtering

`Array.prototype.filter()` creates a new array that only includes the elements that pass the test implemented in the function. This function **has to** return a boolean.

```js
const lowerThanFour = numbers.filter(number => {
    return number < 4;
});

console.log(lowerThanFour);
```

Useful later down the line when there are multiple objects and you need to filter them when collected in an Array of objects.

### Reducing

`Array.prototype.reduce()` executes a "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the previous return value from the calculation onto the next element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

```js
const total = numbers.reduce((reducer, number) => {
    return reducer + number;
}, 0);

console.log(total);
```

The first time that the callback is run there is no "return value of the previous calculation". Therefore we needed to define the reducer to an initial value of 0 as part of the arguments for the `.reduce()` method. If this is not initialised, the reducer will take the first value in the array, no matter what data type it is (including objects), therefore it is important to include it.

### Example with Array of Objects

```js
const colin = {
    name: "Colin",
    age: 27
}
const kevin = {
    name: "Kevin",
    age: 30
}
const zsolt = {
    name: "Zsolt",
    age: 28
}

trainers = [colin, kevin, zsolt];

initialValue = 0;

const totalAge = trainers.reduce((reducer, trainer) => {
    return reducer + trainer.age;
}, 0);

console.log(totalAge);
```

## HTML-CSS-JavaScript

**HTML is the frame and content of a house**. So things like chairs, tables, doors, stairs, the bare essentials of what constitutes a house, nothing more.

**CSS is the paint and the rounded edges** of a house that makes visually appealing and comfortable to live in. Technically, the definition of a chair is something that you sit on, but things like shape, size, and padding (design) is what makes chairs comfortable (or uncomfortable) to sit on.

**JavaScript is the electricity and water supply** that makes a modern home a modern home, and makes taking baths, cooking food, and not freezing to death during the winter possible. A JavaScript developer make sure that light switches on when you flip the switch, and hot/cold water comes out when you turn the water tap.

### UX (User Experience)

The overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application. How easy or pleasing it is to use.

### Wireframe

- A wireframe is the outline of a web page or app
- Wireframes provide an overview of layout, structure, user flow and functionality
- Can come in different fidelities (rough sketch, mid, full on detail)

### Considerations

- Consider that the app may be spread across multiple devices
- May wish to consider mobile first as it has the most limitations
- Accessibility is one other to consider (UK: understanding accessbility requirements for the public sector)
- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

### Possible Workflow

- Start with list
- Pen and paper
- Digital wireframe - Figma, Sketch, Invision, Excalidraw

### Task

Task: have a go at Crazy Fours/Eights: fold a piece of paper into 4 or 8 and sketch out some possible homepage layouts for a mobile app

**Requirements**

- Logo
- Newsletter sign up
- Link to main menu
- Link to shopping cart
- Link to collections (suggestions: Kids, Women, Men, Home)

### Semantic HTML

Hypertext Markup Language

Semantic HTML means uses that word with its proper meaning in its proper context, therefore writing HTML5 as it was mean to be.

Currently HTML5 is the used version of HTML.

**HTML Elements**

- `<ol>` - ordered list
- `<ul>` - unordered list
- `<li>` - list item inside ol or ul
- `<h1> to <h6>` - headers
- `<p>` - paragraph
- `<div>` - section (vague)
- `<img>` - image

**Why use semantic HTML?**

- HTML can take complex structure with many elements
- Especially a problem with the rise of frameworks, code can be hard to read
- Semantic HTML improves readability, therefore easier to maintain
